Network Sniffer Project in Python

I'd be happy to help you with building a basic network sniffer in Python. A network sniffer is a program that captures and analyzes network traffic, allowing us to understand how data flows on a network and how network packets are structured.

Project Requirements

To build a basic network sniffer, we'll need to:

    Capture network packets using a Python library
    Analyze the captured packets to extract relevant information (e.g., source and destination IP addresses, packet length, protocol)
    Display the analyzed information in a user-friendly format

Python Libraries

We'll use the following Python libraries for this project:

    scapy: a powerful packet sniffer and analyzer library
    python-pcapy: a Python wrapper for the libpcap library, which allows us to capture network packets

Project Structure

Our project will consist of the following components:

    sniffer.py: the main script that captures and analyzes network packets
    packet_analyzer.py: a module that extracts relevant information from captured packets
    display.py: a module that displays the analyzed information in a user-friendly format

Implementation

Here's a high-level overview of how we can implement the network sniffer:

    Capture Network Packets: We'll use scapy to capture network packets on a specific interface (e.g., eth0).
    Analyze Captured Packets: We'll use packet_analyzer.py to extract relevant information from the captured packets, such as source and destination IP addresses, packet length, and protocol.
    Display Analyzed Information: We'll use display.py to display the analyzed information in a user-friendly format, such as a table or a graph.



Next Steps

Before we proceed, I'd like to confirm a few things:

    Are there any specific requirements or features you'd like to include in the network sniffer?
    Would you like to capture packets on a specific interface or all available interfaces?
    Are there any specific protocols or packet types you'd like to focus on?
